# Helm hooks and tests

## Helm hooks

Helm provides a **hook mechanism** to **perform operations at strategic
points** in a release lifecycle. The available `hooks` are:

- `pre-install`: Executes after templates are rendered, but before any
    resources are created in Kubernetes
- `post-install`: Executes after all resources are loaded into Kubernetes
- `pre-delete`: Executes on a deletion request before any resources are
    deleted from Kubernetes
- `post-delete`: Executes on a deletion request after all of the release's
    resources have been deleted
- `pre-upgrade`: Executes on an upgrade request after templates are
    rendered, but before any resources are updated
- `post-upgrade`: Executes on an upgrade request after all resources have
    been upgraded
- `pre-rollback`: Executes on a rollback request after templates are
    rendered, but before any resources are rolled back
- `post-rollback`: Executes on a rollback request after all resources have
    been modified
- `test`: Executes when the Helm test subcommand is invoked

Hooks are just Kubernetes manifest files with **special annotations**
in the metadata section. See below:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: {{ .Release.Service | quote }}
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name | quote }}
    app.kubernetes.io/version: {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}
    helm.sh/chart: "{{ .Chart.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Version }}"
  annotations:
    # This is what defines this resource as a hook. Without this line, the
    # job is considered part of the release.
    "helm.sh/hook": post-install
    "helm.sh/hook-weight": "-5"
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": hook-succeeded
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: {{ .Release.Service | quote }}
        app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name | quote }}
        helm.sh/chart: "{{ .Chart.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Version }}"
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: post-install-job
        image: "alpine:3.3"
        command: ["/bin/sleep","{{ default "10" .Values.sleepyTime }}"]
```

## Helm tests

In some cases, you may want to write tests to **validate** that your chart
**works as expected** when it is installed.

- Tests **should be placed** under the `templates/` directory and is a job
definition that specifies a `container` with a command to run.
- The container **should** exit successfully (`exit 0`) for a test to be
considered a success.
- The job definition **must contain** the helm test hook annotation
`helm.sh/hook: test`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: "{{ include "demo.fullname" . }}-test-connection"
  labels:
    {{- include "demo.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": test
spec:
  containers:
    - name: wget
      image: busybox
      command: ['wget']
      args: ['{{ include "demo.fullname" . }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}']
  restartPolicy: Never
```

To run tests, follow theses steps:

- Install the chart on the cluster to create a release
- Wait for all `Pods` to become active
- Run the test by running `helm test <releasename>`
