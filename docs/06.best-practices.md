# Development best practices

## Charts

### Naming convention

Chart names **should be Kebab-case**. Lower case letters and numbers.
Words may be separated with dashes (`-`):

- drupal
- nginx-lego
- aws-cluster-autoscaler

## Values

### Naming convention

Variable names **should** begin with a lowercase letter, and words should be separated with **camelcase**:

```yaml
create: true
serviceAccountName: "foo"
```

### Nest values

YAML is a flexible format, and values may be **nested deeply or flattened**.
In most cases, **flat should be favored** over nested.

Nested:

```yaml
server:
  name: nginx
  port: 80
```

Flat:

```yaml
serverName: nginx
serverPort: 80
```

### Suplying values

There are three potential sources of **values**:

- A default `values.yaml` file
- A values file supplied by `helm install -f` or `helm upgrade -f`
- The values passed to a `--set` or `--set-string` flag on `helm install`
  or `helm upgrade`

### Document the `values.yaml` file

Every defined property in `values.yaml` **should be documented**. It facilitates
the compreension on how a value must be set when providing custom values.

## Manifests

### Is it a Label or an Annotation?

An item of metadata should be a label under the following conditions:

- It is used by `Kubernetes` to **identify this resource**
- It is useful to **expose to operators** for the purpose of querying the system

If an item of metadata is not used for querying, it **should be set as an
annotation** instead.
