# Helm chart structure

A chart is organized as a **collection of files** inside a directory. In
the directory, Helm expects a structure that matches this:

```ls
chartname/
  Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart
  LICENSE             # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing the license for the chart
  README.md           # OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file
  values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart
  values.schema.json  # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
  charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
  crds/               # Custom Resource Definitions
  templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                      # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
  templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes
```

## The `Chart.yaml` file

This file is required and is used to **define the chart itself**. A `Chart.yaml`
file example is shown below but you can find available fields [here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chartyaml-file).

```yaml
# Chart.yaml example
apiVersion: v2 # v1 or v2 (required)
name: example-chart # chart name (required)
version: v1.0.0 # SemVer 2 version (required)
description: A Helm example chart # describe your chart
type: application # application or library
appVersion: v0.1.0 # your app version
```

## Chart `LICENSE`, `README` and `NOTES`

These files are optional but can be **useful** for describing the installation,
configuration, usage and license of a chart.

## `charts/` directory

A chart **may depend on** any number of other charts.  These dependencies
can be dynamically linked using the dependencies field in `Chart.yaml`
(**recomended**) or brought in to the `charts/` directory and managed manually.

The required charts are downloaded and saved in the `charts/` directory
during an installation or upgrade.


## `templates/` directory

**Templates** are a **fundamental part of a chart** and are stored in the
`templates/` folder. When Helm renders a chart, it will **pass every file
in that directory through the template engine**.

**Templates** are written in the [Go template language](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
with the addition of **template functions** from the [`Sprig`](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) library.

### Template values

Values for the templates are supplied two ways:

- Developers may supply a file called `values.yaml` inside of a chart.
    This file can contain default values.
- Users may supply a YAML file that contains values. This can be provided
    on the command line with `helm install`.

Values that are supplied via `values.yaml` file or the `--set` flag
are accessible from the `.Values` object in a template.

Tips on how to use **templates** in a Helm chart can be found [here](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/).

## `crds/` directory

Kubernetes provides a mechanism for **declaring new types of Kubernetes
objects**. Using [`CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs)`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions),
developers can **declare custom resource types**.

Custom Resource Definition files **should** be placed in the `crds/` directory
inside of a chart. Helm will attempt to **load all of the files in the `crds/`
directory** into Kubernetes.

CRD files **cannot** be templated. They must be plain YAML documents.

## `values.yaml` files

A values file is written in `YAML`. A chart **may include default
`values.yaml` file**. The Helm install command allows overriding values
by supplying **additional YAML values** via `--values` and `--set` flags.

```yaml
# values.yaml example
nameOverride: ""
namespaceOverride: ""
commonLabels: {}
commonAnnotations: {}

image:
    name: nginx
    tag: latest
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

## Defining Values Schema

In some cases, you want to **define a structure to values** passed to a
chart. This can be done by **defining a schema** in the `values.schema.json`
file. An example is shown below:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "properties": {
    "image": {
      "description": "Container Image",
      "properties": {
        "repository": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "tag": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "type": "object"
    },
    "name": {
      "description": "Service name",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "port": {
      "description": "Port",
      "minimum": 0,
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "protocol": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "protocol",
    "port"
  ],
  "title": "Values",
  "type": "object"
}
```

This schema will be **applied** to the values for validation. It occurs
when any of the following commands are invoked:

- `helm install`
- `helm upgrade`
- `helm lint`
- `helm template`
