# Helm Plugins

Helm plugins provide a way of **extending the core feature set of Helm**.

- They can be added and removed from a Helm installation **without
impacting** the core Helm tool.
- They can be written in any **programming language**.
- They integrate with Helm, and will **show up** in helm help and
other places.
- Helm plugins live in `$HELM_PLUGINS`.

To install a plugin, you can:

- Run `helm plugin install <plugin-url>` command.
- `untar` the plugin into the `$HELM_PLUGINS` directory.

You can find Helm plugins [here](https://helm.sh/docs/community/related/#helm-plugins)
or searching in [Github](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahelm-plugin&type=Repositories).

For more information, see the [plugins](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/plugins/)
section in the official documentation.
