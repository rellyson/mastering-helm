# Helm library charts

Library charts help defining **common definitions** that can be
shared among Helm charts. This way, you can **share** snippets
of code that can be **re-used across charts**, avoiding repetition
and keeping charts DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself).

You can go to [library charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/)
topic in the official documentation for more information.

### Importing charts

Before using a library chart, you need to **import it**. You can import
charts by **declaring** them in the `Chart.yaml` file as a dependency.

```yaml
# Chart.yaml example
apiVersion: v2
name: example-chart
version: v1.0.0
description: A Helm example chart
type: application
appVersion: v0.1.0

# Declare required charts
dependencies:
    - name: examplelib # libary chart name
      version: 0.1.0 # library chart version
      repository: "" # your chart repository
```

After declaring the required charts, run `helm dependency update <chart path>`
to copy them to the `charts/` directory.

## Example

An example of using a library chart to provide base templates
to an application chart is available in `charts/lib-example` directory.
