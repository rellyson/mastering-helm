# Sharing your Helm Charts

In some cases, you want to **share** your charts to be
used by other users or even imported by other Helm Charts.
Sharing Helm Charts is done via **Chart repositories**.

A chart repository is a location where packaged charts
can be **stored and shared**. When you're ready to share
your charts, the preferred way to do so is by **uploading
them to a chart repository**.

## Sharing using an HTTP server

When using an HTTP server as a chart repository, the
server **should serve** an `index.yaml` file and optionally
some packaged charts.

There are several ways to serve a chart repository. You can
see some options in the [hosting chart repositories](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/#hosting-chart-repositories)
section in the official documentation.

## Sharing using OCI-based registries

Another option to share Helm charts is using an **OCI-based
container registry**. Beginning in Helm v3.8.0, OCI support is
enabled by default.

Some hosted registries are:

- `Amazon ECR`
- `Azure Container Registry`
- `Docker Hub`
- `Google Artifact Registry`
- `Harbor`
- `IBM Cloud Container Registry`
- `JFrog Artifactory`

When using an OCI-based registry, the registry reference must
be prefixed with `oci://`.

```sh
helm pull oci://localhost:5000/helm-charts/mychart --version 0.1.0
```

### Commands for working with registries

```sh
# Login to a registry
helm registry login -u user oci://<registry-url>

# Upload a chart to an OCI-based registry
#
# The push command can only be used with .tgz files
# created using helm package command
helm push chart-0.1.0.tgz oci://<registry-url>/helm-charts
```

## Sharing using Git repositories

There is a third option to share your Helm Charts via **`Git`
repositories** using a **Helm Plugin**.

The [helm-git](https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git) Plugin
provides a way of distributing Helm Charts using `Git`.
See the repository for more information.
